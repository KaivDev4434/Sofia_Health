**End Users**: Patients booking appointments
**Business Model**: SaaS platform where providers can manage appointments and accept payments

## Tech Stack
- **Backend**: Django 5.0+
- **Database**: SQLite (default, easy to switch to PostgreSQL)
- **Payment**: Stripe API (test mode)
- **Frontend**: Django Templates (minimal, clean UI)
- **Dependencies**: django, stripe, python-decouple (for env variables)

## Core Features (MVP)

### 1. Appointment Model (MVP)
```python
# Core required fields
- provider_name (CharField, max_length=200)
- appointment_time (DateTimeField)
- client_email (EmailField)

# Payment tracking
- is_paid (BooleanField, default=False)
- amount_paid (DecimalField, default=50.00)
- stripe_payment_intent_id (CharField, optional)

# Healthcare context (for future features)
- appointment_type (CharField, choices=['consultation', 'follow-up'], default='consultation')
- notes (TextField, blank=True) # Patient notes/reason for visit

# Metadata
- created_at (DateTimeField, auto_now_add)
- updated_at (DateTimeField, auto_now)
```

### 2. Booking Flow
**Step 1: Create Appointment**
- Form-based appointment creation
- Validate appointment time (must be in future)
- Validate email format

**Step 2: Payment**
- Redirect to payment page after appointment creation
- Create Stripe PaymentIntent (test mode)
- Display mock payment confirmation
- Update appointment.is_paid on success

**Step 3: Confirmation**
- Success page with appointment details
- Send email confirmation (optional - use console backend for testing)

### 3. Views/Endpoints
- `GET/POST /appointments/create/` - Create appointment form
- `GET /appointments/<id>/payment/` - Mock payment page
- `POST /appointments/<id>/confirm-payment/` - Confirm payment
- `GET /appointments/<id>/success/` - Success page

### 4. Admin Interface
- Register Appointment model in Django admin
- List view with filters (is_paid, appointment_time)
- Search by provider_name, client_email

## Implementation Details

### Stripe Integration (Test Mode)
- Create PaymentIntent with test key
- Amount: Fixed $50 (configurable)
- No actual webhooks (simplified)
- Use test card: 4242 4242 4242 4242
- Store payment_intent_id in appointment model

### Validation & Security
- CSRF protection (Django default)
- Email validation
- Future date validation for appointments
- Environment variables for sensitive data

### UI/UX
- Clean, minimal Bootstrap 5 styling
- Mobile-responsive (critical for patients booking on-the-go)
- Professional, trustworthy design (healthcare context)
- Clear error messages and validation feedback
- Simple 3-step flow with progress indicator
- Accessibility considerations (WCAG basics)

## Environment Variables
```
SECRET_KEY=<django-secret-key>
DEBUG=True
STRIPE_PUBLISHABLE_KEY=<stripe-test-pk>
STRIPE_SECRET_KEY=<stripe-test-sk>
```

## Security & Privacy (MVP Level)
While this MVP is not fully HIPAA-compliant, we implement foundational security:
- **HTTPS Ready**: Force HTTPS in production settings
- **CSRF Protection**: Django built-in
- **SQL Injection Protection**: Django ORM
- **Environment Variables**: Sensitive data not in code
- **Secure Password Storage**: Django's pbkdf2_sha256 (when auth added)
- **Input Validation**: All form fields validated
- **Privacy by Default**: Minimal data collection
- **No PHI (Protected Health Information)**: MVP collects only appointment scheduling data
  
**Future Compliance Path**: Clear roadmap to HIPAA compliance in Phase 3

3. **Validate payment flow** before investing in complex features
4. **Gather feedback** on must-have vs. nice-to-have features
5. **Show investors** a working prototype with clear scaling vision

## Healthcare SaaS Competitive Landscape
Similar platforms for reference:
- **Calendly** (general scheduling)
- **SimplePractice** (therapy/mental health)

## Key Success Metrics to Track (Future)
- Provider sign-ups (conversion from demo)
- Appointments booked per provider (usage)
- Payment conversion rate (patient completion)
- Monthly Recurring Revenue (MRR) & Annual Run Rate (ARR)
- Provider churn rate
- Customer Acquisition Cost (CAC) vs Lifetime Value (LTV)
- Average revenue per provider (ARPU)
- Time-to-first-appointment for new providers
- Net Promoter Score (NPS)

## Notes
- Code will be clean, well-commented, and PEP 8 compliant
